# Creatinga a neural network 
The neural network has inputs layer with 4 nodes and hidden layer  has 6 nodes and 3 output node 
Weights and biases are initialised to 1 
Feeds fordwardstep the inputs to compute the output with sigmoid activation function
calculate the loss between outputs and target  using the sum of square loss
Backpropagate the methoid of updating weights and biases using a learning rate of 0.1
